# Introduction to Hegic-dev
-------
Hegic-dev is is a repository maintained by the Hegic community. The purpose of the repository is to create resources to ease development on Hegic Protocol and provide the community with guides on how to interact with the range of Hegic functions, tools and instruments.

## Introduction to Hegic

Hegic is an on-chain options trading protocol on Ethereum.

You can buy WBTC or ETH call and put options as an individual holder (buyer) or sell ETH call and put options as one of the liquidity providers on [Hegic](https://www.hegic.co).

Trade on-chain options for profits or to hedge your positions.

And here is why you won't be able to distinguish Hegic from the pure magic:

- Non-custodial 24/7 global options trading
- Verified on-chain settlement of each option contract
- Choose any strike price for WBTC or ETH Call / Put options
- Exercise at any moment during the period of holding a contract
- Exercising is guaranteed by the liquidity locked on an option contract
- Mobile compatible interfaces for trading on the go using WalletConnect
- Censorship-resistant protocol without a KYC, email or registration required
- Earn yield on WBTC or ETH as one of the liquidity providers
- Liquidity auto diversification among all the contracts for the options writers
