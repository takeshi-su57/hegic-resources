# How to become a Hegic Liquidity Provider

## Abstract

Hegic Liquidity Providers (LPs) are one of the core Hegic ecosystem participants. LPs provide liquidity to the Hegic protocol in the form of Ether (ETH) or Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) in order for users to purchase options against. As all options on Hegic are 100% collateralized by the underlying (ETH or WBTC), the more liquidity provided by LPs, the more options that can be writen on Hegic.

To better understand the potential rewards from becoming a Hegic LP, you can visit this community [Hegic LP yield estimator](https://larrypcdotcom.github.io/hegic-yield-estimator/) developed by [Larry](https://twitter.com/Larrypcdotcom).

Note: There are significant risks associated with providing liquidity to Hegic that may or may not be offset/compensated by the premiums and/or the current rHEGIC incentive program. Please make sure to understatnd the LP risks prior to becoming an LP.

## High level process to becoming an LP

To participate as a Hegic LP and start earning your share of option writer premiums and rHEGIC rewards, there are 10 steps required:
1. You will need to have either [WBTC](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599) or ETH in your wallet.
2. Select the pool that you wish to become a liquidity provider for.

3. Approve the contract through the UI of your wallet.
4. Confirm the deposit transaction which will include the total amount of wBTC or ETH that you will deposit through the UI of your wallet.
5. Await for the confirmation that your transaction was successful. At this stage, you will have received writeWBTC or writeETH.
6. Select the same pool that you wish to become a liquidity provider for in the [token holder] section.
7. Approve the staking contract through the UI of your wallet.
8. Confirm the staking transaction which will include the total amount of writeWBTC or writeETH that you will stake through the UI of your wallet.
9. Await for the confirmation that your transaction was successful.
10. Sit back, start earning passive income and watch the HEGIC tokens flow in.

## Important considerations before becoming a Hegic LP

1. Write tokens have a 14-day lock period once minted. Further, staked tokens incur a minimum 14-day lock period as well. These lock periods do not overlap, i.e. if you stake write tokens you will have to wait 14 days to unstake, and then ANOTHER ADDITIONAL 14 days to convert write tokens back to ETH or WBTC. These lock-ups are not for user inconvenience but to maintain stability in the liquidity pools.
2. The Hegic LP incentive program issues rHEGIC as a reward. rHEGIC represent a 1:1 claim for future HEGIC at a yet to be determined date. The conversion process will start shortly after the Hegic protocol reached $100m in total options value, or on 11-Nov-2021 (whichever comes first). Once this process begins, only 1/24 (~4.17%) of rHEGIC will be convertable every week for 24 weeks. 
3. Hegic LPs 'pay' the profits to successful Option Holders. This exposes the LP pool to potential losses of the initial capital provided. Losses are socialized across the whole pool but still worth considering prior to becoming an LP.

## Detailed walkthrough for providing liquidity

### You will need to have/acquire either wBTC or ETH in your wallet (Step 1)

#### Obtaining Ether (ETH)
There are numerous ways that you can obtain or ETH. The most common and popular method is to use local centralized exchanges and fiat on-ramps. For a pretty comprehensive list of available exchanges and markets check out [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum#markets).
#### Obtaining Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)
WBTC is an ERC-20 version of Bitcoin where 1 WBTC = 1 BTC. Increasingly, centralized exchanges are providing markets for WBTC, but still the most popular avenue to acquire WBTC is through decentralized exchanges such as [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599&outputCurrency=ETH). Again, [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin#markets) has a comprehensive list of WBTC markets and their volume. To use these decentralized exchanges you will need to have ETH or other ERC-20 tokens. The easiest to obtain ERC-20 tokens and most liquid pairs outside of ETH are typically stablecoins such as [USD Coin (USDC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48) or [Tether (USDT, ERC-20 version)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7).


### Deposit into a liquidity pool and mint writeWBTC or writeETH (Steps 2-5)

Open the [Hegic website](hegic.co) and connect your wallet. Your wallet will need to be connected to interact with the Hegic protocol's LPs and make them availble through the webpage UI.

Navigate to the WRITERS tab.

Scroll down to the section /// PROVIDE LIQUIDITY and select the liquidity pool that you wish to participate in. 

![Provide Liquidity](https://i.imgur.com/NZHYAC5.jpg)

Enter The amount of WBTC or ETH that you wish to provide to the liquidity pool. Once decided, hit the DEPOSIT button. Your wallet will request your permission to:
1. Approve the smart contract
2. Confirm the transaction

Once the transaction has been confirmed, you will have provided to the liquidity of HEGIC’s bidirectional liquidity pools and will have received [writeWBTC](https://etherscan.io/token/0x20dd9e22d22dd0a6ef74a520cb08303b5fad5de7) or [writeETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0x878f15ffc8b894a1ba7647c7176e4c01f74e140b) in your wallet!

### Stake your writeWBTC or writeETH to participate in the [rHEGIC incentive program](https://medium.com/hegic/hegic-rewards-distribution-continues-how-to-earn-phase-i-rewards-with-lock-ups-29545bf43a44) (Steps 6-10)

Navigate to the [TOKEN HOLDERS] section of the Hegic website.

Now conduct the following steps to stake your tokens to start accumulating rHEGIC:
1. Select the pool that correspond to the write tokens you created in the previous steps.
2. Your full balance of write tokens will then be visible on the Hegic UI.
3. Click the LOCK TOKENS button and select the amount of write tokens that you wish to stake in the pop-up that appears. Once you click the confirm button you will be asked to approve the smart contract and confirm the staking transaction in your wallet’s UI.
4. Once both are transactions are confirmed you will see your locked ‘write’ tokens on the Hegic UI (you may need to refresh the page).
5. Experience the magic and observe here as you will start to see your HEGIC rewards (rHEGIC) accumulate instantly!!
